NAME
====

uncov-gcov is coverage information collector for C and C++ languages that can be
used with **uncov(1)**.

**NOTE:** since uncov-gcov isn't the only way to collect C and C++ coverage for
uncov anymore, it is deprecated.  However, it is still provided as it might
potentially work better in some contexts.  It's better to switch to using
"uncov new-gcovi".
